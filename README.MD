# Sentiment Analysis - Reviews YELP
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/MarcosMota/SentimentAnalysisYelp)

In order to encourage the learning of artificial intelligence, YELP provides business datasets, assessments and user data for use in personal, educational and academic purposes.

In this one, we will focus on evaluation data, where the goal is to develop a classifier that can distinguish "positive" and "negative" messages.
For this task we will use several Deep Learning techniques, such as:
- Perceptron
- LSTM
- BERT

# Technology Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Docker
- Angular 10
- Python
    
# New Features!
  - Classify positive and negative using Perceptron
  - API for expose model
  - Create of the angular design architecture
  - Create of the docker architecture


* [Pytorch] - Framework by Deep Learning
* [Numpy] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Jupyter Notebook] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.


### Trainning Model

The project require [Pytorch](https://nodejs.org/) v1.2.2+ to run.

After install dependencie, run file train.py.

```sh
$ cd model
$ python train.py
```

### Todos

 - Implement BERT transformer
 - Create Web PAge
